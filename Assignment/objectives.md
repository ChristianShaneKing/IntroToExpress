#Express Routing Assignment

1. create a brand new Express App from scratch
2. create a package.json using 'npm init' and add express as a dependency
3. in your main app.js file add 3 routes

Visiting "/" should print "Hi there, welcome to my assignment!"
========================================================
Visiting "/speak/pig" should print "The pig says 'Oink'"
Visiting "/speak/dog" should print "The dog says 'Woof'"
Visiting "/speak/cow" should print "The cow says 'Moo'"
========================================================
Visiting "/repeat/hello/3" should print "hello hello hello"
Visiting "/repeat/hello/5" should print "hello hello hello hello hello"
Visiting "/repeat/blah/2" should print "blah blah"

If a user visits any other route, print:
"Sorry, page not found... What are you doing with your life?"
